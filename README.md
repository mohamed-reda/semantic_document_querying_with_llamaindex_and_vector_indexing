## Project Overview

This repository brings together four projects that leverage **LlamaIndex**, **ChromaDB**, and **ReAct Agents** to build advanced AI-powered systems.

Each project has a different use case:

- ranging from semantic document querying
- math expression evaluation
- conversational chatbots.

The projects are designed to showcase my expertise in integrating **large language models** (**LLMs**), **vector databases**, and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** techniques.

## Key Features

- **Semantic Search**: Use vector embeddings and similarity-based retrieval to query documents semantically.
- **Vector Indexing**: Efficiently store and retrieve document embeddings using ChromaDB.
- **Conversational Agents**: Build interactive chatbots capable of answering questions based on indexed data.
- **Math Expression Evaluation**: Leverage ReAct agents to evaluate complex mathematical expressions step-by-step.
- **Reusable Templates**: Modular design allows easy adaptation for new datasets or use cases.

### Acknowledgments

- **LlamaIndex**: For providing powerful tools for indexing and querying documents.
- **LlamaParse**: For enabling robust PDF parsing capabilities.
- **OpenAI**: For powering the natural language processing components.

### Directory Structure

- `data/`: Place your dataset files here (e.g., PDFs, text files).
- `chroma_db/`: Persistent storage for ChromaDB collections.
- `storage/`: Persistent storage for vector indices.

### Configuration

Each project uses a `setup_models` function to configure the underlying LLMs and other settings. This function abstracts away the model initialization process, making it easy to switch between different LLM providers (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face).

#### What is `setup_models`?

The `setup_models` function initializes the LLMs and other configurations required for the projects. It typically includes:

- Setting up the embedding model (e.g., OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002`).
- Configuring the LLM provider (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4).
- Defining global settings like temperature, max tokens, etc.

Example:

```python
from llama_index.core import Settings
from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI


def setup_models():
    Settings.llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0.1)
    Settings.embed_model = "local"  # or "openai"
```

You can modify this function to experiment with different models or configurations.

## Projects

### 1. Document Query Engine with ChromaDB

This project demonstrates how to build a **document query engine** using **ChromaDB** as the vector database. It loads documents, creates a vector index, and performs semantic queries to retrieve relevant information.

#### Key Features:

- Loads documents from a directory.
- Creates or loads a persistent vector index using ChromaDB.
- Uses a retriever and response synthesizer to generate answers.

#### Example Query:

**Input:** "What did Paul Graham learn from his painting experience?"  
**Output:** A detailed response about Paul Graham's insights into painting.

---

### 2. Document Indexing and Retrieval

This project focuses on **document indexing and retrieval**. It indexes documents into a vector store and retrieves information based on user queries.

#### Key Features:

- Indexes documents into a persistent storage (`storage/` folder).
- Loads the index from storage if it already exists.
- Retrieves information using a query engine.

#### Example Query:

**Input:** "What are the design goals and give details about it please."  
**Output:** A summary of the design goals of AUTO GEN STUDIO.

---

### 3. Math Expression Evaluator using ReAct Agent and LLM

This project showcases a **math expression evaluator** powered by a **ReAct agent**. The agent uses tools like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to evaluate mathematical expressions step-by-step.

#### Key Features:

- Defines custom tools for basic arithmetic operations.
- Uses a ReAct agent to solve math problems interactively.
- Provides step-by-step reasoning for each calculation.

#### Example Query:

**Input:** "Use a tool to calculate every step of: 20 + (2 * 4) / (5 - 1)"  
**Output:** A step-by-step breakdown of the calculation, resulting in `22`.

---

### 4. Full Conversational Chatbot in CMD

This project builds a **conversational chatbot** that interacts with users via the command line. The chatbot is powered by a vector index and can answer questions based on the indexed data.

#### Key Features:

- Loads data and creates a vector index.
- Uses a chat engine to handle conversational queries.
- Supports interactive conversations until the user types "exit".

#### Example Interaction:

**User:** "What did Paul Graham do after YC?"  
**Agent:** A detailed response about Paul Graham's activities post-Y Combinator.

## Conclusion

This repository demonstrates my expertise in building AI-powered systems for semantic document querying, math expression evaluation, and conversational agents. Each project is modular, reusable, and designed to be easily extended for new use cases. By leveraging **LlamaIndex**, **ChromaDB**, and **ReAct agents**, these projects showcase the potential of combining vector indexing and large language models to create intelligent applications.
